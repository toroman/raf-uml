## New feature ##
_February 10th, 2008_ : Ivan added one very useful feature to our program. Now you can easily position all relations in 0, 45 or 90 degrees. I think it is called "snapping". It is in the SVN repository, check it out if you can not wait for the release to see it :)
## 1.0.1 Java Web Start released ##
_January 27th, 2008_ : After just one day we have spotted funny new bugs which we have hopefully solved, many of them related to serialization. For some reason, opening a file from file system explorer by using double click or context menu, may not work, so in that case _use the regular File-Open..._ method. Please delete your existing RAF UML version by Add/Remove programs or by running ` javaws -viewer ` command, and install the newest version if you have experienced this bug.
## Final release 1.0 ! ##
_January 26th, 2008_ : We are proud to present you the final release of our UML editor! This version will be examined by our professors and hopefully used by our colleagues :) Please remember that you will need Java SE 6 installed to run this program properly. If you think you don't have Java 6, you can install it from [java.com website.](http://www.java.com)
